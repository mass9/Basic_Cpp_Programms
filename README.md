->Compile & Execute C++ Program:

Let's look at how to save the file, compile and run the program. Please follow the
steps given below:

1. Open a text editor and add the code as above.

2. Save the file as: Name0.cpp    .
You can give any name you want, just take care it should have cpp extension.

3. Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the
file.

4. Type 'g++ Name0.cpp' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no
errors in your code the command prompt will take you to the next line
and would generate a.out executable file.

5. Now, type 'a.out' to run your program
